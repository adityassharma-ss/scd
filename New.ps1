To implement the described solution, the following detailed steps can be undertaken in SCOM (System Center Operations Manager) to delay alerts and identify leading indicators of service down events:


---

1. Delay the Alert for 10 Minutes

You can configure a delay in alert generation by modifying the monitor settings in SCOM. Hereâ€™s how:

A. Identify the Monitor

1. Open the Operations Console in SCOM.


2. Navigate to Authoring > Monitors.


3. Locate the monitor related to the Avecto service. Use search if necessary.



B. Modify the Monitor

1. Right-click on the identified monitor and select Properties.


2. Go to the Diagnostics and Recovery tab.


3. Look for the Alerting Delay or configure a custom script that adds a delay in triggering the alert.

Alternatively, set a condition detection logic using a Timed Event Reset or a Consecutive Sample Rule.

This ensures the service is checked continuously for 10 minutes before alerting.




C. Example Configuration for Consecutive Samples

Set the number of samples required for a state change:

Healthy to Critical: 5 consecutive failures at 2-minute intervals.

This introduces a 10-minute window before the alert is raised.



D. Test and Deploy

Test the configuration in a non-production environment.

Deploy the changes to production once verified.

2. Analyze Patterns Leading to Service Down Events

To identify patterns, you can use performance counters, correlation analysis, and SCOM data warehouse:

A. Enable Performance and Event Monitoring

1. Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) for the Avecto service (e.g., CPU usage, memory consumption, I/O).


2. Configure SCOM to collect performance data for these metrics.



B. Correlate Alerts with Usage Conditions

1. Use the SCOM Data Warehouse to analyze historical alerts and performance data.


2. Look for correlations between:

Workload spikes.

Specific usage conditions or resource constraints.

Patterns in failures (e.g., after specific updates or actions).




C. Use Log Analytics (Optional)

1. Integrate SCOM with Azure Log Analytics or other SIEM tools.


2. Perform detailed log analysis to identify root causes and leading indicators.

3. Automatic Restart of Avecto Service

To reduce downtime, configure automatic recovery actions for the Avecto service in SCOM:

A. Configure Recovery

1. In the monitor properties, go to the Diagnostics and Recovery tab.


2. Add a recovery task:

Select Restart the Service as the action.

Set the action to run automatically upon service failure.




B. Test Recovery Workflow

Verify that the service restarts successfully in test scenarios.

Monitor the impact on downtime reduction.

4. Additional Recommendations

Alert Suppression: Suppress repeated alerts during the 10-minute window.

Custom Alerts: Create custom monitors with threshold-based alerting for better control.

Integration with Automation Tools: Use tools like PowerShell scripts or Azure Automation to identify and resolve patterns.
