Generate a hierarchical team structure based on the user-provided project details and duration. The team structure should:

Include the following roles (if applicable):
Delivery Leader (overall responsibility).
Reporting Managers (managing specific aspects of the project).
Team Members (developers, designers, testers, etc.).
Specify PODs (teams or subgroups) with team names or focus areas (e.g., frontend, backend, QA).
Include designations for all roles and clarify reporting relationships.
Produce a tree structure format that visually represents the hierarchy.
Tailor the team size and composition to the project requirements and duration.
