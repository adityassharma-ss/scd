Instructions for the Model:

1. Ensure the code is complete and error-free.


2. Include comments to describe the functionality of each part of the code.


3. Handle potential edge cases and exceptions, if applicable.



This prompt ensures that the generated code is professional, functional, and easy to understand. Let me know if further refinement is needed!
