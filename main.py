The image outlines an Observability Roadmap with various tasks and deliverables spanning from Q4 2024 to Q4 2025. Here's a breakdown of each item and general guidance on how to set them up and work upon them:


---

Q4 2024:

1. Prod Cluster Deployment:

Task: Deploy production-ready Kubernetes or cloud-based clusters for hosting applications.

Setup:

Use tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to provision the cluster.

Implement best practices like network policies, role-based access control (RBAC), and monitoring.

Deploy workloads and verify stability.




2. SSO Integration:

Task: Configure Single Sign-On for applications and services.

Setup:

Use SSO providers like Okta, Azure AD, or PingIdentity.

Integrate with OIDC or SAML protocols.

Test SSO flows across environments.




3. EM Integration:

Task: Integrate an Event Management system for detecting, logging, and resolving incidents.

Setup:

Use tools like PagerDuty, ServiceNow, or Jira Service Management.

Configure event triggers from monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus alerts).

Set up escalation policies and workflows.




4. Logging Standardization:

Task: Create a consistent structure for application and infrastructure logs.

Setup:

Use log management tools like Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK) or Loki and Grafana.

Define log format (e.g., JSON) and establish logging levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR).




5. Metric Instrumentation via Palladium:

Task: Implement metric instrumentation for apps using Palladium.

Setup:

Integrate Palladium with your app to collect metrics like latency and resource usage.

Configure Palladium agents on hosts.




6. Trellix Alternative POC and Implementation:

Task: Evaluate and implement an alternative solution to Trellix (a monitoring tool).

Setup:

Research alternatives like Dynatrace or DataDog.

Perform a feature comparison, deploy a pilot project, and gather feedback.




7. Agent Installation:

Task: Install agents for monitoring tools across environments.

Setup:

Use automation tools like Ansible or Chef to deploy agents for Prometheus, New Relic, etc.

Test agent health and data reporting.




8. KONG Onboarding:

Task: Integrate KONG API Gateway.

Setup:

Install KONG Gateway on Kubernetes or standalone.

Configure routes, plugins (e.g., rate-limiting), and upstream services.




9. Blackbox POC:

Task: Set up a POC for blackbox monitoring.

Setup:

Use tools like Prometheus Blackbox Exporter.

Configure probes for HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP monitoring.

Deploy dashboards for visualizing results.




10. DxP URL Monitoring:

Task: Monitor critical URLs for Digital Experience Platforms.

Setup:

Use synthetic monitoring tools (e.g., New Relic Synthetics).

Test response times, uptime, and error rates.






---

Q1 2025:

1. URL Monitoring Transition to Prometheus & Grafana:

Task: Move existing URL monitoring to an open-source stack.

Setup:

Use Prometheus Blackbox Exporter and configure Grafana dashboards.

Migrate alerting rules from the legacy tool.




2. Migration from Cloud-native Monitoring Solutions:

Task: Transition to self-hosted monitoring solutions.

Setup:

Deploy Prometheus and Grafana stacks in your cluster.

Replace proprietary tools with open-source equivalents.






---

Q2 2025:

1. Dashboard Templates:

Task: Create reusable Grafana templates for monitoring.

Setup:

Use Grafana provisioning files (JSON) for consistent dashboards.

Include metrics for CPU, memory, disk, and application-specific KPIs.




2. Anomaly Detection POC:

Task: Pilot anomaly detection for monitoring.

Setup:

Use tools like Prometheus Alertmanager, Grafana Machine Learning plugin, or external tools like Datadog.

Train models on historical data to detect anomalies.




3. FARO POC:

Task: Implement FARO (observability framework).

Setup:

Deploy FARO agents in applications.

Configure data collection and analysis workflows.






---

Q3 2025:

1. Alert & Query Optimization for Optimal Performance:

Task: Tune alerts and queries to reduce noise and improve relevance.

Setup:

Use PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) and configure thresholds appropriately.

Review and refine Alertmanager configurations.




2. Distributed Tracing POC & Implementation:

Task: Enable tracing across services.

Setup:

Deploy tracing tools like Jaeger or OpenTelemetry.

Instrument applications with trace context propagation.






---

Q4 2025:

1. Decommission Federated Grafana, Prometheus & Kibana:

Task: Retire federated monitoring stacks.

Setup:

Migrate dashboards and data to centralized instances.

Update alerting endpoints.
