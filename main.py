To replicate prebaked configurations with production modifications, you need a structured approach to reuse the base configuration (used for staging or development) while applying production-specific changes. Here's a step-by-step flow to achieve this:


---

Step 1: Understand Prebaked Configurations

Prebaked configurations are reusable templates that define infrastructure, services, or application setups. They usually contain:

Common settings: resource sizes, dependencies, network configurations, etc.

Environment-agnostic parameters: defaults suitable for all environments.


For example:

# prebaked-config.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: my-app:latest


---

Step 2: Identify Production-Specific Modifications

Production requires modifications for:

Scaling: Increase replicas or resource allocation.

Security: Use stricter permissions or enable SSL/TLS.

Environment Variables: Add production-specific variables like database endpoints or secrets.

High Availability: Configure multi-zone setups or failover mechanisms.


For example:

# production-config-modification.yaml
spec:
  replicas: 5
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: "500m"
              memory: "256Mi"


---

Step 3: Choose a Configuration Management Method

1. Declarative Tools:

Use Kustomize, Helm, or Terraform to layer production modifications on top of prebaked configurations.



2. Scripting:

Use scripts (e.g., Ansible, Bash) to dynamically apply changes to prebaked configurations.



3. Version Control Branching:

Keep prebaked configurations in one branch (e.g., main) and production modifications in another branch (e.g., production).

Step 4: Apply a Tool or Process to Layer Configurations

Option 1: Using Kustomize

Kustomize overlays allow you to start with a base and add production-specific modifications:

1. Base Prebaked Configurations:

# base/deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 2


2. Production Overlay:

# overlays/production/kustomization.yaml
resources:
  - ../../base
patchesStrategicMerge:
  - replicas-patch.yaml

# overlays/production/replicas-patch.yaml
spec:
  replicas: 5


3. Deploy:

kubectl apply -k overlays/production/



Option 2: Using Helm

Helm charts allow dynamic values injection:

1. Chart Template:

# templates/deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ .Values.appName }}
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.replicas }}


2. Default Values:

# values.yaml
appName: my-app
replicas: 2


3. Production Overrides:

# values-production.yaml
replicas: 5


4. Deploy:

helm install my-app ./chart -f values-production.yaml



Option 3: Using Terraform for Infrastructure

1. Define Prebaked Module:

# modules/base/main.tf
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  instance_type = var.instance_type
}


2. Override in Production:

# production/main.tf
module "base" {
  source        = "../modules/base"
  instance_type = "t3.large"
}


3. Apply Configuration:

terraform apply -var-file="production.tfvars"




---

Step 5: Use Environment-Specific Pipelines

Incorporate prebaked and modified configurations into your CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment:

1. Fetch Prebaked Configuration:

Clone or retrieve prebaked configurations from version control.



2. Apply Production Modifications:

Use tools or scripts to apply overlays or dynamic environment variables.



3. Deploy to Production:

Push the final configuration to production.




Example Pipeline (GitHub Actions):

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Deploy prebaked configurations
        run: |
          kubectl apply -f prebaked-config.yaml

      - name: Apply production modifications
        run: |
          kubectl apply -f production-config-modification.yaml


---

Step 6: Test and Verify

1. In Staging:

Test prebaked configurations with production modifications applied.



2. In Production:

Validate deployment success and check logs or monitoring systems.





---

Key Best Practices

1. Reusability:

Always build prebaked configurations as reusable templates.



2. Modularity:

Keep production-specific changes isolated to ensure clarity and maintainability.



3. Version Control:

Track changes separately for prebaked and production modifications.



4. Testing:

Test modifications in a staging environment before production deployment.
