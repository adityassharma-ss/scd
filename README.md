DB SoX monitoring and compliance refer to the processes and strategies organizations implement to adhere to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) regulations, which are designed to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures. Below is a detailed explanation of key components related to DB SoX monitoring and compliance.
Overview of DB SoX Monitoring
DB SoX Monitoring involves the use of tools and practices to audit and monitor database activities, ensuring that all actions comply with SOX requirements. This includes:
Monitoring Database Activity: Continuous oversight of user interactions with the database, including who accesses the data, what changes are made, and when these actions occur. This helps identify unauthorized access or anomalies that could indicate fraud or data breaches13.
Ensuring Data Integrity: Organizations must validate that their financial data is accurate and complete. This involves implementing measures such as primary keys, unique indexes, and constraints to maintain data quality36.
Audit Controls: Establishing robust audit trails that log all database activities is critical for compliance. These logs should be stored securely and be accessible for review during audits
