Key Differences Between Standard Metrics and Custom Metrics:

1. Source: Standard metrics are automatically provided by Azure for all resources, while custom metrics are user-defined and collected from custom applications or scripts.


2. Setup: Standard metrics require no configuration as they are collected by default. Custom metrics require manual setup using the Azure Monitor API, SDK, or custom scripts.


3. Cost: Standard metrics are free to collect and store for 90 days. Custom metrics are free for the first 50 MB per month, after which charges apply for ingestion and storage.


4. Data Type: Standard metrics track resource health (like CPU, memory, and network usage). Custom metrics track business-specific metrics (like order processing time or queue length) specific to an application.


5. Usage: Standard metrics are used for infrastructure monitoring. Custom metrics are used for application performance tracking and business logic monitoring.
