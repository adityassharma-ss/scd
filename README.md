Summary Report: Citrix Broker Service Monitoring
Incident Overview:
On MCCCAGUCTXDC02, the Citrix Broker Service (responsible for handling application availability) did not start after a scheduled reboot, resulting in unavailability of the PAS-X application and a plant-wide outage. Manual intervention resolved the issue, but no alerts were generated despite SCOM monitoring being in place.

Findings:

Monitoring Gap: The Citrix Broker Service was not configured for monitoring in SCOM.
Alerting Issue: No alerts were triggered because the service was not included in the monitoring scope.

Actions Taken:

Verified monitoring configuration in SCOM.
Confirmed no existing Citrix-specific management packs or service monitors.
Identified the need to configure custom monitoring for the Citrix Broker Service.
Recommendations:

Set up monitoring for the Citrix Broker Service in SCOM.
Test and validate alert configurations.
Conduct periodic reviews of critical service monitoring.
Next Steps: Configure and test monitoring for all essential Citrix services
