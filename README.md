Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring Strategy in Azure

This document details the management, configuration, and monitoring of logs in Azure for both infrastructure and application-level activities. The primary goal is to establish a robust, scalable, and enterprise-grade logging framework that integrates automation, monitoring standards, and compliance across diverse Azure services and tenants.


---

Overview

Effective logging is essential for diagnosing issues, monitoring system performance, and ensuring compliance. This document categorizes logs into multiple types, explains their use cases, and provides a strategy for configuring, processing, and querying them.

Primary Log Types

1. Application Logs
Captures logs related to application events and activities. These include:

Application Insights Logs: Diagnostic and request data generated by Azure Application Insights.

Error Logs: Logs capturing exceptions and errors at runtime.

Performance Metrics: Metrics for latency, throughput, and resource utilization.



2. Infrastructure Logs
Logs for system resources, including:

Virtual Machines: Status, performance, and diagnostic logs.

Kubernetes Clusters (AKS/EKS): Logs capturing container lifecycle events, resource usage, and network interactions.



3. Traffic Logs
Captures details about network traffic. Examples include:

Network Flow Logs: Logs showing inbound and outbound traffic data.

Firewall Logs: Logs capturing rule evaluations and security events.



4. Security Logs
Focuses on auditing and compliance by tracking events such as:

User logins and access patterns.

Unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activities.



5. Netman Logs
Specialized logs for network management systems.

Key for monitoring bandwidth, routing issues, and service-level agreements (SLAs).

Log Processing and Standards

Automated Logging Configuration

Logging configurations across Azure services are automated using Terraform.

Diagnostic settings for each service ensure all relevant logs are sent to appropriate destinations (e.g., Log Analytics Workspace, Event Hubs, or Storage Accounts).

Default diagnostic settings automatically capture common logs without requiring manual intervention.


Log Standards

Logs follow standardized formats to ensure uniformity:

Timestamping: All logs include precise timestamps in ISO 8601 format for accurate event correlation.

Structured Fields: Logs are organized into JSON-like structures for ease of querying.

Query Capabilities: Using Azure Monitor KQL (Kusto Query Language) to filter and analyze logs efficiently.

Monitoring Services

Azure Application Insights

Provides end-to-end application performance monitoring.

Captures key metrics such as:

HTTP request/response data.

Dependency calls and success rates.

Failures, exceptions, and traces.


Integrated with Azure Monitor for seamless analysis.


Log Analytics Workspace

Centralized repository for logs from multiple services.

Features include:

Log Queries: Enables filtering logs by service, type, or severity.

Visualization: Dashboards for trend analysis and troubleshooting.

Integration: Logs routed from diagnostic settings, with ingestion limits managed at ~20 logs/sec for each storage account.



Virtual Machines (VMs)

Diagnostics are enabled at the VM level using Terraform for automation.

Logs include:

OS-level events such as startup/shutdown.

Batch processing logs for applications deployed on VMs.



Container Monitoring

Kubernetes clusters, including AKS and EKS, are monitored through container logging frameworks.

Integration with OpenSearch:

Requires agent installation for capturing and processing container logs.

Ensures container lifecycle events, diagnostics, and alerts are logged systematically.




---

Tenant and Region-Based Management

Global and China Tenants

Azure architecture accommodates global tenants and China tenants.

Distinctions include:

Global Tenants: Operates across multiple regions (e.g., US, Europe).

China Tenants: Dedicated environment with stricter compliance and specific integration conditions.



Terraform Modules for Multi-Region Management

Custom Modules: Designed to manage both global and China tenants with tailored configurations.

Integration Conditions: Specific configurations are implemented to ensure compliance in the China environment.



---

Migration and Cost Optimization

Incremental Migration

Services are migrated to Azure one by one to maintain stability.

Logs are compared post-migration to ensure consistency between old and new environments.


Cost Optimization

Efforts to reduce logging costs include:

Evaluating open-source tools like OpenSearch for self-hosted log analysis.

Consolidating services to eliminate redundancy across multiple cloud platforms.




---

Challenges and Recommendations

Log Filtering

Azure allows global event ingestion, but log filtering is essential for extracting actionable insights.

Filters are defined based on:

Severity levels (e.g., error, warning, informational).

Specific service types (e.g., storage diagnostics, VM logs).



Scaling Diagnostic Settings

Diagnostic configurations can be complex across multiple services and regions.

Automation with Terraform ensures consistent settings and reduces manual errors.


Network Monitoring

Current efforts focus on the network feasibility team managing traffic logs.

Tools like Azure Network Watcher enhance monitoring capabilities.



---

Best Practices

Automation and Standardization

Use Terraform for defining, provisioning, and maintaining logging configurations.

Maintain standardized log formats and fields for consistency across services.


Dedicated Workspaces

Assign separate Log Analytics Workspaces for key teams or services to maintain isolation and organization.


Proactive Monitoring

Define alerts in Azure Monitor for critical logs or metrics.

Establish thresholds for performance degradation, downtime, or security breaches.


Compliance

Conduct regular audits on security and access logs.

Implement RBAC policies for accessing logs, ensuring compliance with organizational standards.


Regional Redundancy

Leverage multi-region setups for global availability.

Ensure separate configurations for special regions like China to meet local regulations.



---

Next Steps

Immediate Actions

1. Define and deploy Terraform modules for logging diagnostics across services.


2. Configure Log Analytics Workspaces for different teams (e.g., app monitoring, infrastructure).


3. Begin testing global vs. China tenant integration.



Long-Term Goals

1. Transition to open-source tools for cost reduction and independence.


2. Develop robust log querying dashboards using Azure Monitor and third-party visualization tools.


3. Regularly update Terraform modules to accommodate new services and compliance requirements.
