Subject: Update on Monitoring and Actions for Servers CONFRVASQLP1, CONFRVAOPCP2, and CONFRVAOPCРЗ

Dear [Recipient's Name/Team],

I have reviewed the current monitoring setup in SCOM for the servers mentioned in INC000000488156. Below are the findings and next steps:


---

Findings:

1. Current Monitoring:

The following metrics are being tracked for CONFRVASQLP1, CONFRVAOPCP2, and CONFRVAOPCРЗ:

CPU Utilization

Memory Utilization

HDD Free Space (e.g., Availability-C:, Availability-D:)


The associated health rollups and performance metrics are active, including hardware availability and OS performance.



2. Application Service (INTOUCH-VDR-PRD):

This application service is not currently listed in SCOM.



3. Post-Migration Updates:

The servers have been successfully moved to the Kenvue.com domain, but monitoring configurations for domain-specific changes need verification.



4. Alert Configuration:

Thresholds for critical metrics need to be reviewed (e.g., CPU > 90%, HDD < 20%) to ensure proper escalation.

Next Steps:

1. Monitoring Gaps:

Coordinate with the monitoring team to add the INTOUCH-VDR-PRD service under the relevant servers.

Validate alert routing and ensure notifications are sent to the correct contacts.



2. Server Contact Communication:

Confirm monitoring requirements or any additional configurations with Eric Le Garrec and Frederic Renard.



3. Documentation and Testing:

Document updated thresholds and monitoring configurations.

Test alerts to ensure they are functioning correctly post-migration.
