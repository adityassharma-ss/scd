Here’s a structured MNC-level document for the Disk Space Alert System, including all necessary sections such as Executive Summary, Business Impact, Technical Implementation, Governance, and Appendices.

Disk Space Alert System – MNC-Level Document

1. Executive Summary

1.1 Objective

The Disk Space Alert System ensures proactive monitoring of server storage to prevent performance degradation, service disruptions, and system failures. Alerts are triggered based on percentage of free disk space and remaining free space in MB.

1.2 Scope

This document applies to all Windows Server 2012, 2016, and later versions, including Active Directory (AD) servers managed under enterprise infrastructure.

1.3 Key Highlights
	•	Alerts are generated only when both the percentage threshold and MB threshold are breached.
	•	Three alert levels: Healthy, Warning, and Critical (Error).
	•	Configurations aligned with Monitor Management Packs.
	•	Supports Cluster Disk Alerts for high-availability environments.

2. Business Impact

2.1 Risks of Insufficient Disk Space

Risk Factor	Business Impact
Application Downtime	Service unavailability, revenue loss
Performance Degradation	Slow response times, operational inefficiencies
Data Loss Risks	Potential corruption of critical files
Compliance Issues	Violation of data retention policies

2.2 Expected Benefits
	•	Proactive Monitoring: Timely alerts prevent downtime.
	•	Improved System Performance: Optimal disk space utilization.
	•	Compliance Assurance: Adheres to corporate IT governance standards.

3. Alert Matrix: Conditions for Warnings & Critical Alerts

This matrix defines the thresholds that trigger alerts.

Server Type	Alert Type	Condition 1: % Free Space	Condition 2: Free MBs	Operational State
Windows 2012	Warning	Not specified	≤ 500 MB (System Drive)	Warning
Windows 2012	Critical	Not specified	≤ 300 MB (System Drive)	Error
Windows 2016+	Warning	≤ 10%	≤ 500 MB (System Drive)	Warning
Windows 2016+	Critical	≤ 5%	≤ 300 MB (System Drive)	Error
Windows 2016+	Warning	≤ 10%	≤ 2000 MB (Non-System)	Warning
Windows 2016+	Critical	≤ 5%	≤ 1000 MB (Non-System)	Error
AD Servers	Warning	≤ 20%	N/A	Warning
AD Servers	Critical	≤ 10%	N/A	Error

4. Technical Implementation

4.1 Architecture

The Disk Space Alert System is integrated within the Monitor Management Packs, leveraging performance counters for:
	1.	Logical Disk Free Space (MB)
	2.	Logical Disk % Free Space

The alert system is configured using System Center Operations Manager (SCOM), monitoring disk usage in real-time.

4.2 Monitoring Flow
	1.	Data Collection
	•	Performance counters collect disk usage data every 15–60 minutes.
	2.	Threshold Evaluation
	•	If both percentage threshold and MB threshold are breached, an alert is generated.
	3.	Notification Trigger
	•	Alerts are sent via email, SMS, and ITSM integration (e.g., ServiceNow).
	4.	Incident Management
	•	Alerts are classified as Warning or Critical, triggering automated or manual remediation.

5. Configuration & Thresholds

	•	Step 3: Review historical trends.
	•	Step 4: Implement preventive measures (storage expansion, archiving).

8. Conclusion

This Disk Space Alert System ensures proactive monitoring, alerting, and resolution of disk space issues across Windows and AD servers. The structured approach aligns with enterprise IT governance, compliance, and incident management best practices.
