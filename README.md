Azure Observability and Monitoring: Gap Analysis and Areas for Improvement


---

1. Introduction

This report highlights the current state of observability and monitoring in Azure, identifies existing gaps, and proposes areas for improvement. The goal is to establish a more robust, cost-effective, and scalable monitoring framework that aligns with MNC-level best practices. The report also provides logical reasoning for each recommendation.

2. Current State of Observability and Monitoring

The current setup incorporates a comprehensive logging and monitoring strategy using Azure's core services, including Application Insights, Log Analytics, and Azure Monitor. Key elements include:

Log Types:

Application Logs: Capturing events, errors, and performance metrics.

Infrastructure Logs: Logging the state and performance of Azure VMs, AKS clusters, and Kubernetes container lifecycle events.

Traffic Logs: Monitoring network flows and firewall security logs.

Security Logs: Tracking user access, failed login attempts, and unusual activities.

Netman Logs: Used for network bandwidth, routing, and SLA adherence.


Log Processing and Configuration:

Automated logging setup using Terraform.

Centralized log routing to Log Analytics Workspaces, Event Hubs, and Azure Storage.

Logs follow a standardized format (ISO 8601 timestamps, JSON structure) to simplify querying.


Monitoring Tools:

Azure Application Insights for tracking application performance, request/response data, and error rates.

Log Analytics Workspace for multi-service log aggregation, trend analysis, and troubleshooting.

Storage Accounts as storage locations for raw log data.

VM Logs: OS-level logs for system events, batch processing, and container logs (via OpenSearch).


Tenant & Region Management:

Separate configurations for Global Tenants and China Tenants, ensuring regulatory compliance and region-specific integration.

Use of Terraform modules to streamline multi-region management.


Cost Optimization:

Migrating services incrementally to Azure.

Exploring open-source log management tools like OpenSearch to reduce Azure logging costs.

3. Identified Gaps and Areas for Improvement

1. Log Filtering and Noise Reduction

Gap: Excessive logging results in storage bloat, high ingestion costs, and difficulty in identifying actionable insights.
Area for Improvement:

Implement Log Filtering: Configure log filters for severity levels (Error, Warning, Informational) and service-specific logs.

Rationale: Reducing noise enhances focus on critical events and optimizes storage and ingestion costs.
Steps to Address:


1. Implement log severity filtering (Error/Warning) in diagnostic settings.


2. Use KQL (Kusto Query Language) to create specific log filters for key services.


3. Automate filter configurations using Terraform modules.




---

2. Standardization of Log Formats

Gap: Inconsistencies in log format (timestamps, JSON structure) make it difficult to query, visualize, and correlate logs.
Area for Improvement:

Enforce Uniform Log Formatting: Use ISO 8601 timestamps and JSON-like structures for all logs.

Rationale: Consistent log formats simplify querying, enable better visualizations, and ensure compatibility with external tools like OpenSearch or Grafana.
Steps to Address:


1. Update Terraform configurations to enforce a unified log format.


2. Use Kusto scripts to clean and reformat old logs in Log Analytics Workspace.




---

3. Scaling Diagnostic Configurations

Gap: Managing diagnostic settings for multiple services, regions, and tenants is complex.
Area for Improvement:

Automation of Diagnostic Configuration: Use reusable and consistent Terraform modules.

Rationale: Manual configurations are error-prone. Automation ensures uniformity across environments and regions.
Steps to Address:


1. Create modular Terraform templates for diagnostic settings (for AKS, VMs, Storage, etc.).


2. Enable default logging configurations for new services.


3. Regularly update modules to support new Azure services.




---

4. Network Traffic Monitoring

Gap: Limited network visibility for inbound/outbound traffic and rule evaluation.
Area for Improvement:

Expand Network Traffic Monitoring: Leverage Azure Network Watcher for enhanced visibility.

Rationale: Comprehensive monitoring of traffic flows and firewall logs ensures better security and network optimization.
Steps to Address:


1. Enable Network Watcher for all Azure regions.


2. Route Network Flow Logs and Firewall Logs to Log Analytics for unified analysis.


3. Configure alerts for unusual traffic spikes and policy violations.




---

5. Cost Optimization and Log Storage

Gap: High log ingestion and storage costs due to unfiltered logging.
Area for Improvement:

Use Open-Source Tools (e.g., OpenSearch): Reduce reliance on costly Azure-native storage.

Rationale: Offloading logs to OpenSearch (self-hosted) reduces ingestion fees, especially for archived logs.
Steps to Address:


1. Redirect historical logs from Log Analytics to OpenSearch.


2. Use Terraform to define log routing rules for multi-destination storage.


3. Evaluate log retention policies to reduce storage bloat.




---

6. Improved Tenant Management

Gap: Variations in log configurations for Global and China tenants.
Area for Improvement:

Unify Log Management Across Tenants: Tailor Terraform modules to support tenant-specific configurations.

Rationale: Simplified multi-tenant management reduces configuration drift and improves operational consistency.
Steps to Address:


1. Use a "single source of truth" approach for tenant configurations.


2. Parameterize region-specific requirements (like for China) in Terraform modules.




---

7. Enhanced Monitoring & Alerting

Gap: Current alerting focuses on reactive responses rather than proactive monitoring.
Area for Improvement:

Proactive Monitoring & Alerting: Use Azure Monitor Alerts to detect anomalies before they impact services.

Rationale: Early detection of issues minimizes downtime and improves incident response.
Steps to Address:


1. Set alert thresholds for critical metrics (latency, throughput, failures).


2. Use anomaly detection on log patterns to catch unusual activity.


3. Configure notification channels (e.g., email, Teams, PagerDuty) for rapid response.

4. Best Practices and Recommendations

5. Logical Approach for Implementation

1. Gap Analysis: Identify weak points in log management and alerting mechanisms.


2. Define Requirements: Set goals for logging, filtering, and cost optimization.


3. Automation: Use Terraform modules to ensure consistent configurations.


4. Tool Integration: Link Azure Monitor with OpenSearch for hybrid log management.


5. Standardization: Ensure log formats follow ISO 8601 and JSON-like structures.


6. Testing & Validation: Run queries using KQL, review alerts, and validate cost optimizations.


7. Rollout & Monitoring: Deploy changes incrementally (region-by-region).




---

6. Long-Term Goals

Migrate to Open-Source Monitoring: Reduce dependency on Azure-native services.

Automated Compliance Checks: Set up regular scans to validate log compliance.

Tenant-Specific Dashboards: Create dashboards tailored for each tenant (China, Global) to monitor metrics in isolation.

Cost Reduction: Evaluate cost-effective storage options for logs, such as cold storage or archive tiers.

7. Conclusion

This report outlines essential improvements in Azure observability, focusing on cost reduction, log filtering, automation, and alerting. The recommended measures ensure better control, reduced operational overhead, and enhanced security. By using open-source tools, unified formats, and proactive alerting, the system will achieve scalability, compliance, and long-term cost optimization.
