**Enhanced and Fixed Transcript**

**DevSecOps Presentation**

**0:13 - Introduction**
Hello, team.

**0:14 - Overview**
This is a **work cloud citizen policy** application. The application features a **VS Code Plugin** as the front end.

**0:18 - System Workflow**
Currently, to run this application locally, we have two main processes:
1. **Vector Image Creation**: The system generates vector images locally.
2. **Database Processing**: PostgreSQL is used to create embeddings and retrieve relevant data.

**0:43 - Running the Application**
To start the application:
- Pull the repository.
- Run the Python back-end server using the start command.
- The front-end allows users to input requests and generate **SCDS (Security Control Definition System)** data.

**1:05 - User Input Example**
Users can input requests like:
- *"Generate security control definitions for Azure Uber Disk Service."*
- Click the **Generate SCDS** button to start the process.

**1:27 - Processing Time**
- It takes approximately **two minutes** to generate the requested security control definitions.

**1:32 - Automation of SCDS Creation**
The application automates **SCDS creation**, which is traditionally a manual and lengthy task.

**1:43 - AI Integration**
We are integrating AI (GPT-4.0) to:
- Process data.
- Use security control benchmarks from **public cloud, NIST, and CIS**.
- Generate embeddings and fetch data based on user queries.

**2:21 - Data Embeddings**
- The application creates embeddings from datasets and retrieves security definitions dynamically.
- The output is generated within **a couple of minutes**.

**2:28 - Current Limitations**
- Currently supports **18-19 SCDS** at a time.
- Can be expanded based on demand.

**2:36 - Output Formats**
Users can export SCDS in multiple formats:
- **Markdown** (GitHub-compatible)
- **CSV**
- **Excel**

**2:48 - File Storage**
- Markdown files can be uploaded to **GitHub**.
- Excel files can be stored and accessed locally.

**3:18 - Final Output**
- The generated security control definitions provide structured guidelines for securing cloud resources.
- They follow security standards and best practices.

**3:31 - Future Scope**
- **Integration with Cloud Policy Generation**:
  - Policies will be compatible with **Terraform and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)**.
  - Helps enforce security measures and protect cloud resources.

**3:52 - Second Process: Database Integration**
- We are implementing **vector databases** to store and retrieve security definitions more efficiently.
- Embeddings are created from datasets for enhanced data retrieval.

**4:01 - Local Setup and VS Code Plugin**
- The repository includes a **VSIX file** for the VS Code plugin.
- Users can follow the **README file** to install and set up the application locally.

**4:40 - Conclusion**
Thank you for your time. This concludes the **SCDS application** overview.
