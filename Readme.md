Designing the Prometheus Architecture:

Decide between a centralized or federated Prometheus setup based on load, network segmentation, and redundancy requirements.
Plan for high availability and scalability of the Prometheus server, including storage and retention policies.
Alerting & Visualization Strategy:

Map current ElastAlert rules to new Prometheus Alertmanager configurations.
Prepare a list of existing Grafana dashboards that need reconfiguration to utilize Prometheus as a data source.
