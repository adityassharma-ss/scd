To provide a detailed cost estimate for your Azure setup, let’s break down the components based on your provided information:

1. Azure Event Hubs:

Azure Event Hubs pricing depends on the selected tier and the number of throughput units (TUs) or processing units (PUs) allocated.
	•	Standard Tier:
	•	Throughput Units (TUs): Each TU provides 1 MB/s ingress and 2 MB/s egress.
	•	Pricing: Approximately $0.03 per hour per TU.
	•	Premium Tier:
	•	Processing Units (PUs): Each PU offers higher throughput and additional features.
	•	Pricing: Approximately $1.027 per hour per PU.

2. Azure Monitor:

Azure Monitor’s costs are primarily based on data ingestion and retention.
	•	Log Data Ingestion:
	•	Pricing: Approximately $2.76 per GB ingested.
	•	Data Retention:
	•	First 31 Days: Free.
	•	Beyond 31 Days: Approximately $0.10 per GB per month.

3. Azure Resource Graph API:

Azure Resource Graph allows you to query resources at scale.
	•	Pricing: Generally free for basic usage.

4. Assumptions:
	•	Data Volume:
	•	Ingress: 10 TB per month.
	•	Egress: 10 TB per month.
	•	API Queries:
	•	Frequency: 80,000 queries every 60 seconds.
	•	Total Queries per Month: 80,000 queries * 60 minutes * 24 hours * 30 days = 345,600,000 queries.
	•	Dashboard Access:
	•	Users: 25 users.
	•	Refresh Interval: 60 seconds.
	•	Response Time:
	•	Scenario 1: 80 seconds.
	•	Scenario 2: 15 seconds.

5. Cost Calculations:
	•	Azure Event Hubs:
	•	Standard Tier:
	•	Throughput Units: Assuming 10 TUs.
	•	Monthly Cost: 10 TUs * $0.03/hour * 730 hours = $219.00.
	•	Premium Tier:
	•	Processing Units: Assuming 10 PUs.
	•	Monthly Cost: 10 PUs * $1.027/hour * 730 hours = $7,500.10.
	•	Azure Monitor:
	•	Log Data Ingestion:
	•	Monthly Data: 10 TB = 10,000 GB.
	•	Monthly Cost: 10,000 GB * $2.76/GB = $27,600.00.
	•	Data Retention:
	•	Assuming 10% of data retained beyond 31 days:
	•	Monthly Data: 1,000 GB.
	•	Monthly Cost: 1,000 GB * $0.10/GB = $100.00.
	•	Azure Resource Graph API:
	•	Assumed Cost: Free for basic usage.

6. Total Monthly Cost:
	•	Standard Tier:
	•	Event Hubs: $219.00.
	•	Monitor: $27,700.00.
	•	Resource Graph: $0.00.
	•	Total: $27,919.00.
	•	Premium Tier:
	•	Event Hubs: $7,500.10.
	•	Monitor: $27,700.00.
	•	Resource Graph: $0.00.
	•	Total: $35,200.10.

7. Considerations:
	•	Data Transfer Costs:
	•	Ingress: Generally free.
	•	Egress: Charges may apply based on the destination.
	•	API Query Costs:
	•	Azure Monitor: Charges may apply based on the number of metrics and alerts.
	•	Resource Graph API: Generally free for basic usage.
	•	Response Time Impact:
	•	Scenario 1 (80 seconds): Higher latency may require more resources, potentially increasing costs.
	•	Scenario 2 (15 seconds): Lower latency may require more resources, potentially increasing costs.

8. Recommendations:
	•	Optimize Data Collection:
	•	Collect only necessary data to reduce ingestion costs.
	•	Adjust Retention Policies:
	•	Set appropriate data retention periods to manage storage costs.
	•	Monitor Usage:
	•	Regularly review usage patterns to identify and eliminate inefficiencies.
