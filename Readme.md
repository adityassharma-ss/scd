The difference between NonSystemDriveThreshold and SystemDriveThreshold in this configuration lies in how they set alert thresholds for available free space on different types of drives.

1. System Drive Thresholds
	•	SystemDriveWarningThreshold: Triggers a warning if the available free space on the system drive (usually C:) drops below 500 MB.
	•	SystemDriveErrorThreshold: Triggers an error if the available free space on the system drive drops below 300 MB.

2. Non-System Drive Thresholds
	•	NonSystemDriveWarningThreshold: Triggers a warning if the available free space on a non-system drive (e.g., D:, E:) drops below 2000 MB (2 GB).
	•	NonSystemDriveErrorThreshold: Triggers an error if the available free space on a non-system drive drops below 1000 MB (1 GB).

Why Are These Different?
	•	The system drive (C:) typically contains the OS, critical system files, and applications. Even a small amount of free space can be enough for temporary operations.
	•	Non-system drives (D:, E:, etc.) are usually used for storage, databases, or logs, which require more space. Hence, their thresholds are set higher to prevent performance issues.
